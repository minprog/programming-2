## Quiz

The course has one 90-minute quiz. It is "closed-book," meaning that you are allowed as attributes a pen or pencil, and nothing else. One resit is offered, as soon as one (1) week after the quiz.

Unless arranged with the course's heads in advance, quizzes cannot ordinarily be taken at alternative times even if missed by accident, except in cases of medical emergency.

Anything in lectures from weeks 5 through 10 can be on the quiz. So best to review all lecture notes! But a lot more tips on studying are in this review session:

Also, to prepare well, you might have a try at a quiz from previous years:

Finally, if in trouble on a particular topic, there is [CS50 Study](https://study.cs50.net), which has an overview of many important parts of the course and links to all relevant materials on each topic.
